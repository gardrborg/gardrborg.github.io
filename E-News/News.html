          Battlefield V is complicated, sweeping, and enjoyable to play. Its narrative highlights World War II’s lesser known fronts, and its competitive multiplayer is fast-paced and action-focused.
          It’s romantic, it’s exhilarating, and I can’t shake the feeling that something is off about it. For every grand feat of daring, there is a tension that I can’t ignore.
          This piece originally appeared 11/15/18. We’ve bumped it today for the game’s release.
          Battlefield series started with 2002’s Battlefield 1942, a multiplayer first person-shooter that featured vehicles and large scale battles unlike players had seen.
          Since then, the series has expanded and explored numerous settings: Vietnam, modern conflicts, and World War One.
          Its battles have grown more destructive as the series added environmental destruction that levels buildings and transforms maps.
          It is a boastful series focused on scale. More player, more vehicles, more fronts. 2016’s Battlefield 1 changed the tone with a serious look at World War One.
          Now, Battlefield returns to World War Two with a similar self-seriousness.
          <p>
          Battlefield V is divided between two modes with two different moods. The single player “War Stories” focus on bite-sized tales from around the globe.
          They’re seriously-told stories, more docu-drama than Call of Duty’s HBO approach.
          Each War Story is meant to educate players on one of the war’s fronts, focusing not on familiar battles like Normandy, Stalingrad, or Iwo Jima, but on lesser-known aspects of the great global conflict.
          There’s a stealth-heavy mission as a Norwegian sniper, a cautionary tale starring Senegalese soldiers fighting in France, and a rough and tumble special ops campaign about British commandos.
          Developer DICE says it plans to add a final post-release mission focusing on a German panzer unit.
          Combined, the War Stories provide a fresh perspective on a war that video games have milked and enthusiastically recreated for years, and DICE’s narrative team clearly cared about treating each story with respect.
          Compared with the shorter, more numerous single-player missions in 2016’s Battlefield 1, Battlefield V takes its time.
          As a result, each story feels more complete and narratively cohorent.
